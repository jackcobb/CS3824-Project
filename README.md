CS3824-Project
==============

Final group project for CS 3824, Computational Bioninformatics, at VT. We had to create a motif finder that could run for an alloted amount of time and still produce a viable result, even if that time was only a second of runtime. Our found result and score was better than the random motif finder the Professor used as a baseline. It was also producing a beter result than the "optimal" score provided by the Professor, and ranked higher than all the other groups in all the tests that the professor scored us on.
